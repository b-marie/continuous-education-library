# Continuous Education Library
A library or resources useful for ongoing education! As you start learning new technologies you will likely find that you are bombarded with lists of potential resources. I'm collecting my list here for better reference. 

There are a lot of resources here. Way too many for one person to ever look at all of them. I've decided to divide them up, based on topic and learning style, so that you can access them based on how you learn best! Maybe you're best at reading, watching, or doing... Or all three. I tend to switch between them.

How do you know when to move on to a new topic? I generally feel comfortable with a subject when I feel that I can explain it to someone that knows nothing about it. Try it, next time you're in the shower, running on a treadmill, or doing something where your mind can wander a bit. Try explaining it and see if it's something that you're comfortable with. If you were the person listening, what questions would you have at the end? Try to answer those as well. Once you feel comfortable with your explanation, move on to something else!
